# Course Search

## Initial Setup
Before running the script, you need to install following dependencies:
1. [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/install.html)
2. [GraphLab](https://turi.com/download/install-graphlab-create.html)

## Dataset
The repository contains a small dataset for course text (subtitles) from a Coursera case. The dataset can be found in "transcripts" folder. Idea here that each text file here represents a study material, and we want to search the best on for the query. 

User can create their own dataset by compiling all text files into a single folder
