## Implementation

### Training and Building Context

The program trains on text files present in the folder provided in the command line. It considers each document as a candidate. For each document, program computes word count, TF-IDF measure, removes stop words so on. 

### Parsing query
Query is parsed by removing stop words and generating set of words in the query.

### Scoring

Scoring is done by computing BM25 for the query with each document. The matched documents are returned in  order or ranking.
