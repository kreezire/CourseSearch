[MUSIC] Let's start by discussing some areas in
which recommender systems are playing a really active role behind the scenes. And as we're gonna see in this discussion,
depending on the specific application different aspects of the objective we're
trying to optimize are gonna be important. But before we start talking
about recommenders systems, it's really important to talk
about the idea of personalization, because personalization is transforming
our experience of the world. As we talked about in the clustering and
similarity module, there are lots and lots of articles out there. In lots and lots of webpages. And we can't possibly be
expected to browse all of them. So another example here is YouTube. So YouTube, it's quoted that there are roughly 100
hours of video recorded per minute. And the question is what do I care about. You know, I go on YouTube and I wanna
watch some video that's of interest to me. So this is an example, clearly,
of information overload. There's just way too much content there
for me possibly to be able to go and for me to find what I'm interested in without
somebody helping that content come to me. So browsing, the traditional
form of browsing, is history. There needs to be some way in which the content that's relevant to
me is automatically discovered. And so this the notion of personalization,
where we wanna connect users like myself, who goes to YouTube and
items which, in this case, are gonna be videos on YouTube
need to somehow be connected. Okay, so, personalization is gonna play a key role
in this notion of recommender systems and now let's talk about some examples where
recommender systems are very important. So one very classic example that we
mentioned a little bit earlier was this idea of Netflix where,
here people go and they watch videos. And Netflix has this goal of trying to
make suggestions of which movies or TV shows might be of interest
the person who's come to this site. And the question is, how are we gonna
go about doing these recommendations. Another example, again going back to
something we talked about earlier, is Amazon making product recommendations. So you go on to Amazon, you purchase some
product, and you'll see on the site that it makes a recommendation of other
products you might be interested in. But one important thing to
incorporate in these recommendations is the fact that not only do
you have to take into account the interest that the person
had in this one session. So for example here we're showing that
somebody bought a book about websites and might be interested in another
book about web applications or for example my most recent purchase on
Amazon were shoes for my son but the interest that I have in making that
purchase of shoes isn't my only interest. I'm not only looking for
shoes for a one-year old. There are lots of other reasons why
I go to Amazon and make purchases. And if you look at my history of purchases
you're gonna be able to make much better recommendations for
me than just based on a single session. And likewise,
recommendations might change over time. So there's interest in making
recommendations, for example, what I might be interested
in purchasing today. So if you look at my
purchase history a year ago, I was buying a lot of newborn products. So newborn baby products. But that's probably not something that
I'm very likely to purchase today. So the recommendations that
Amazon presents to me today have to adapt with time. So just as on demand video with
personalized recommendation has really revolutionized how people watch movies and
TV shows, likewise there are a lot of websites that provide streaming
audio with personal recommendations. However, in this case unlike
thinking about on demand video here we want one song
to play after another. And what we want is we want
some coherent stream of songs. So songs I've liked I
wanna play similar songs. I don't wanna rapidly switch between for
example some cafe Indi songs, all of a sudden playing
a heavy metal song. But at the same time I don't want a song I just heard
to play again and again and again. So I want some sense of
recommendations that are coherent but I also want them to provide a diverse
sequence of songs for me to listen to. Okay, well another critical area
where recommender systems have played a very active role
is in social networking. So for example on Facebook there
are tons and tons of users. And we wanna form connections
between these users. So for example here might be a graph of
connections between users on Facebook and maybe I'm this pink node right here, and Facebook wants to recommend other people
I might be interested in connecting with. In this application and it's important
to note that both the users and the quote unquote items
are of the same type. We're both people. So when I'm a user on Facebook the things
that are being recommended to me, the items, they are other people. So we're gonna end up with users and items being exactly the same
type in this application. But the recommendation system that we've
talked about have really focused on online media. But more and more, people are realizing
other area's in which recomender systems can play a really important role. And just as one example, we can think about what is
call drug-target interactions. And here, maybe we have some drug
that's been studied, for example, let's talk about aspirin. It's been well studied as a treatment for
headaches. But what if it's discovered to
have some other possible use? So for example, for blood thinning,
for heart patients? If we can find these
types of relationships, if we can repurpose this drug for
some other treatment, then that could be really useful,
because it's really quite costly and lengthy process to get FDA approval for
a completely new drug, but if we can take a drug where
the types of side effects and the possible risks associated
are already well known and well studied. Then it's a lot easier to get approval for
treatment with some other condition, so this is a case where we might say,
if you like Aspirin for headaches, you might also like Aspirin for
your heart condition. So recommender systems are playing an
active role in medicine as just an example of the diversity of applications
where we see these types of systems. >> [MUSIC]
