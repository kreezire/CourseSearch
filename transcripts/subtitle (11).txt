[MUSIC] Okay, so in this module we're gonna
talk about recommender systems. And one prototypical example of where
recommender systems are really useful is in recommending products. So imagine you have a large set of
products and there are some users, and you wanna recommend a subset of
your products to those users. Well the question is,
how are we gonna do this? And what we're going to talk about is how
to use machine learning techniques in order to use the past history of your
own purchases, as well as the purchases of other people, to determine which
products to recommend to you. And recommender systems just have a
really, really wide range of applications and they've exploded in
popularity over the last decade. But Amazon was an early pioneer in this
area, focused on an application we're gonna be talking about,
which is product recommendation. But another example that really
popularized recommender systems was a competition that Netflix ran
starting back in 2006, ending in 2009, where there was a $1 million prize for
the person who provided the best recommender system for
recommending movies to users. And we'll talk a little bit about
that application in this module. But it really spurred a lot
of activity in this area, developing new recommender systems and
a lot of research following that. [MUSIC]
