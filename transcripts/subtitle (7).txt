[MUSIC] Okay, so in this module, we're gonna
talk about clustering and similarity. And the point here is the fact that
often we have lots of observations, and we want to infer some kind of structure
underlying these observations. And in this case,
the structure we're gonna talk about is groups of related observations or
clusters. And as with all of our modules, we're gonna motivate everything with
a real world application, a case study. In this case we're gonna talk about a task
of retrieving documents of interest. [MUSIC]
