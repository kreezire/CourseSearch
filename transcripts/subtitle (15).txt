[MUSIC] There are many ways to shop for
products today. Typically though, you have to use
what's called keyword search. You type a query on a search engine and try to find products that
are interesting to you. But let's look at new ways to shop. So for example, let's say I want to
buy a shoe, or buy a pair of shoes. Now some people just really care about
shoes, I really care about shoes. I have, let's say,
this cool black pair of shoes. It's got some real style to it. I have this other black pair of shoes. It might look to you as most the same, but they're totally different,
totally different styles. I have this crazy dress shoe. They might look transparent to you, but
it's actually a really cool shade of blue. I have this crazy,
two-colored sneakers, which I love. I also have this other really
interesting pair of sneakers, which I bought in Hong Kong,
and they're kind of fun. And everybody knows I like purple,
so I even have this purple boots. >> Forget it, you have a lot of shoes. >> I have a lot of shoes,
but I need more shoes. And so, there's a lot of shoes online. And it's really hard to find the ones
that are interesting, stylish, different, kind of like my style. And if I use keyword search,
it doesn't really help me. If I have to type the dress shoes,
I just find a bunch of boring usual shoes. Although the ones on
the top left-hand corner, they're kind of interesting and stylish. But still,
I want to find something different, and I don't know what keywords to type or
how to search for it. So, what should I do? Let me start by showing you a cool
demo of a new way to shop based on similarity search. Let's talk about something even
more complicated than buying shoes. My sister is a fashion designer and
her birthday's coming up. And I want to buy her
a really interesting, cool gift that she might love. Well maybe I wanna buy her a dress. So if I just use textual keyword
search and I try to look for a dress,
I'm gonna find a bunch of dresses. But I really don't know how to
choose a dress that she'll like just based on these properties here. And I don't know how to describe it. How do you describe the dress
my sister might like? Now, I could say maybe
she loves floral dresses. Even if I say floral dresses, I'm still
presented with a number of options in different kinds of floral dresses,
and her style is pretty unique. So how am I gonna find a dress that really
looks like something she will love? So if I scroll down this list, maybe
I'll see something that catches my eye. Oh here's a floral dress that looks
pretty good, so I'm gonna click on that. And instead of just finding
dresses based on keyword search, I wanna use image similarity
to find similar dresses. So this are dresses that look similar to
this one, just based on image qualities. And you see that now we get dresses
that do have similar properties. And now, this is much easier to to kind
of find something that she might like. But of course, many of these
dresses are a little too usual. And she might want something
a little bit more interesting. So for example,
here's one which has multiple patterns. And now we find dresses that are similar. And you see they have multiple
styles within a dress. How will I know how to describe that? So let me search within the set. And say, oh, you know what,
this one looks pretty good. And if I click on that, you see other
visually similar dresses to this one, but this one looks particularly good. And the more I looks a little bit like
my sister too, so perfect gift for her. [MUSIC]
