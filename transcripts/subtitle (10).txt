[MUSIC] So the normalized count vectors that
we just described helped address some of the issues with our original
proposal of just using raw word counts as our
representation of the document. But there's another issue, which is
often what we'd like to do is really emphasize the important
words in a document. So we're gonna discuss a little bit about
what it means to be an important word and how we can think about emphasizing them. Okay, before we talk about important
words, let's first talk about rare words. So again, let's imagine that we're
reading an article about soccer, and in this article there are lots and
lots of common words like the and player and field and goal. And what we mean by a common word, it's a word that appears
frequently in the corpus. In the corpus, that's just terminology for
all the documents out there that we are looking at when we're
doing this task of retrieval. And what happens though is that these
common words dominate the similarity metric that we talked about when we
compare against other documents because, like I said, these words appear
in lots and lots of documents. Whereas in contrast, there are some very rare words in
this document we're looking at. Words like "futbol" and "Messi",
the specific player we're reading about, that get completely swamped
by all these common words. And these words,
like "futbol" and "Messi", they get swamped because they just
appear very infrequently in the corpus. So let's think about how to increase
the importance of these rare words, because those often are the ones that
are really relevant in describing what's unique about this article, and what might
indicate which other articles out there, Carlos for example,
is interested in reading. Okay, so like we said,
what characterizes a rare word is the fact that it infrequently
appears in the corpus and what we wanna do is we somehow wanna
up-weight these rare words and equivalently to thinking about emphasizing
words that only appear in a few documents, we can think about taking each word and
discounting the weight on that word based on how many documents that
word appears in in the entire corpus. Okay, so a question is, do we really
want to just emphasize the rare words? Well, we clearly don't want to
emphasize the very common words, the words like the and a and
it and everything like that. But what we wanna include are things that
are very relevant for that document. So not just words like Messi, but
also probably soccer and field and goal. Things that describe the sport
that we're looking at, which might be different than even
another article about sports. An article about basketball
that talks about basketball hoop and court and words like that. So in this case, we wanna emphasize
what I'll call important words. Okay? And so what we're gonna trade off
here is we're gonna think about Words that appear very
frequently in the document so they're relevant to the document
that we're currently reading. So I'll call this common locally. And at the same time we want them to
appear relatively infrequently in the corpus so I'll call this rare globally
and what characterizes a quote unquote important word Is some trade off between
this local frequency, and global rarity. [MUSIC]
